## 一、1011. Capacity to ship packages within D days.



### 题目描述

A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.

The $i^{th}$ package on the conveyor belt has weight of `weights[i]`. Each day, we load the ship with package on the conveyor belt (in the order given by `weights[i]` ). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the package on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.



**Example 01**

> **Input:** weights = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], D = 5
> **Output:** 15
> **Explanation:** A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the package in 5 days like this:
>
> 1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
>
> 2nd day: 6, 7
>
> 3rd day: 8
>
> 4th day: 9
>
> 5th day: 10
>
> **Note:** the cargo must be shipped in the order  given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the package into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.



**Example 02** 

>**Input:** weights = [1, 2, 3, 1, 1 ], D = 4
>
>**Output:** 3
>
>**Explanation:**
>
>1st day: 1
>
>2nd day: 2
>
>3rd dayu: 3
>
>4th day: 1, 1



**Constraints:** 

- $ 1 \leq D \leq weights.length \leq 5 \times 10^4  $
- $1 \leq weights[i] \leq 500 $





### **解题思路**

**二分查找**

> 想不到吧！

核心：

1. 确定结果的左边界和右边界，得到一个范围
2. 二分方式，取值，判定与D的关系，从而确定放弃右半区间还是左半区间



```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int D) {
        // 确定二分查找左右边界
        int left = *max_element(weights.begin(), weights.end()), right = accumulate(weights.begin(), weights.end(), 0);
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            // need 为需要运送的天数
            // cur 为当前这一天已经运送的包裹重量之和
            int need = 1, cur = 0;
            for (int weight: weights) {
                if (cur + weight > mid) {
                    ++need;
                    cur = 0;
                }
                cur += weight;
            }
            if (need <= D) {
                right = mid;
            }
            else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
};
```
